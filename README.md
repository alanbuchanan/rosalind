## Leeds Code Dojo - Rosalind exercises
####  Some solutions in ES6 by Rory and Kris

- Tools
 - NodeJS for reading files (it's set up so that you can replace the files in the `txt` folder with the ones given on Rosalind. Not yet set up for writing to files)
 - Mocha and Chai for unit testing.

We got as far as the first 6.

You can `git clone`, `npm install` and `npm test` if you want to see the results and test them out (or expand on them `:)`).
